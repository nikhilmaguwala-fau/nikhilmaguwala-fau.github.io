                    I constantly yearned to learn more and desired to do something different. and thatâ€™s when it happened; the spark I was missing ignited the instant I clicked play on my first Python tutorial video. Since I canâ€™t get enough. Full Stack Development calls to all my passions. It incorporates creativity and problem solving and Iâ€™m allowed to break it to improve code.<br/><br/>

                    Iâ€™m moldable, but I still keep my creative flare intact.<br/> <br/>

                    My speciality includes quickly learning new skills and programming languages, Responsive Design Principles, Optimization, MVVM, and MVC structures for organizing code. So far I have Javascript, Python, Typescript, HTML, CSS, React, React Native, Node JS, Flask, Angular, Django, SQL, Jenkins, Docker, Agile and Git/Github under my belt. Iâ€™m still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding web into my head.</p>
